# Learn Rust by Building a Game Engine

This guide teaches you Rust using the code in this repository: a small
game engine called **duckforge**, which does 2D, 3D (on the CPU or the
graphics card) and physics, and six example programs built on it. Every Rust concept is shown in real code that
you can run, change and break.

- **Part 1** teaches the Rust language, one idea at a time.
- **Part 2** explains how the engine works and why it's built that way.
- **Part 3** has exercises, from "change a number" to "write a new game".

Keep the source files open next to this guide. When you see a file like
`src/canvas.rs`, open it and look at the real code.

## 0. Setup

**Install Rust** from <https://rustup.rs>. It installs three tools:

| Tool     | What it does                                         |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `rustc`  | The compiler. You'll rarely call it directly.        |
| `cargo`  | The build tool and package manager. You'll use this all the time. |
| `rustup` | Installs and updates Rust itself (`rustup update`).  |

On Windows the installer will ask you to install the Visual Studio C++ Build
Tools. Say yes: Rust needs their linker. This project needs Rust 1.87 or
newer; `rustc --version` tells you what you have.

**Run the games** from the project folder:

```sh
cargo run --example hello      # a square you move with the keys or the mouse
cargo run --example shapes     # every 2D drawing function, animated
cargo run --example breakout   # the full Breakout game
cargo run --example physics    # a 2D physics sandbox: click to drop things
cargo run --example world3d    # a 3D world with physics: fly around, throw balls
cargo run --release --example stress3d   # thousands of 3D shapes: how fast is it?
```

The first build takes a few minutes because Cargo downloads and compiles
minifb, wgpu (the graphics card library) and the crates they depend on.
After that, builds are fast. Adding
`--release` gives fully optimized builds, but the project is set up so
normal builds run smoothly too.

Two keys work in every game: **F3** shows the frame rate (frames per
second, or FPS), and **F12** saves a screenshot.

**Cargo commands you'll use:**

| Command            | What it does                                              |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `cargo check`      | Checks your code for errors without building. The fastest feedback. |
| `cargo build`      | Compiles everything.                                      |
| `cargo run --example NAME` | Builds and runs `examples/NAME.rs`.               |
| `cargo test`       | Runs all the tests.                                       |
| `cargo clippy`     | A linter with hundreds of helpful suggestions.            |
| `cargo fmt`        | Formats your code in the standard style.                  |
| `cargo doc --open` | Builds documentation for the engine and opens it in your browser. |

**The project layout:**

```text
Cargo.toml          project name, Rust edition, dependencies, build settings
src/
  lib.rs            the front door: lists the modules, defines the prelude
  engine.rs         the Game trait and the game loop (the only file that uses minifb)

# Part 1: Learning Rust

## 1. Cargo: Rust's build tool

Open `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[package]
name = "duckforge"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2024"
rust-version = "1.87"
description = "A small game engine (2D, 3D and physics), written for learning Rust"

[features]
default = ["gpu"]
gpu = ["dep:wgpu", "dep:pollster", "dep:bytemuck"]

[dependencies]
minifb = "0.28"
wgpu = { version = "30", optional = true }
pollster = { version = "1", optional = true }
bytemuck = { version = "1", features = ["derive"], optional = true }

[profile.dev]
opt-level = 1
```

- A Rust project is called a **crate**. This one is a *library crate*
  because it has a `src/lib.rs`. (A program with a `main` function has a
  `src/main.rs` and is a *binary crate*.)
- `edition = "2024"` picks the version of the language rules. Editions let
  Rust improve without breaking old code. `rust-version` is the oldest
  compiler that can build the project.
- `[dependencies]` lists other crates to download from
  [crates.io](https://crates.io). **minifb** opens a window, shows pixels
  and reports key presses. The other three are only for the GPU renderer
  ([chapter 21](#21-moving-3d-to-the-gpu)): **wgpu** talks to the graphics
  card, **pollster** waits for its `async` setup, and **bytemuck** turns
  data into raw bytes for it. Everything else we write ourselves, because
  that's the point of the exercise.
- `[features]` are optional parts of a crate. `gpu` switches on the three
  `optional = true` dependencies (`dep:wgpu` means "the wgpu dependency"),
  and `default = ["gpu"]` turns it on unless you say otherwise.
  `cargo build --no-default-features` builds a smaller, CPU-only engine.
- `[profile.dev]` changes how normal (debug) builds are compiled.
  `opt-level = 1` turns on light optimization, because code that touches
  every pixel is very slow without any.

Files in `examples/` are small programs that use the library. Each one
starts with:

```rust
use duckforge::prelude::*;
```

That line brings the engine's most-used names (`Game`, `Canvas`, `Color`,
`Vec2`, ...) into scope. We'll see how in [chapter 9](#9-modules-and-visibility).

## 2. Variables, mutability and types

### `let` and `mut`

Variables are created with `let`, and **they can't be changed unless you
say `mut`**:

```rust
let lives = 3;
lives = 2; // error!
```

The compiler refuses:

```text
error[E0384]: cannot assign twice to immutable variable `lives`
help: consider making this binding mutable
```

With `mut` it's fine:

```rust
let mut lives = 3;
lives = 2; // ok
```

This might feel strict, but it means that when you read `let x = ...` you
*know* `x` never changes, which makes code much easier to follow.

### Shadowing

You can declare a new variable with the same name as an old one. The new
one "shadows" the old. `update_ball` in `examples/breakout.rs` does this:

```rust
let step = self.ball_velocity.x * dt;
// ... use step for the x axis ...
let step = self.ball_velocity.y * dt; // a brand new `step`
// ... use step for the y axis ...
```

### Types

Every value has a type. Rust usually works it out for you (`let x = 3;` is
an `i32`), but you can write it out: `let x: f32 = 3.0;`.

The number types in the engine, and why each was chosen:

| Type    | What it holds                   | Where the engine uses it                          |
|---------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `f32`   | 32-bit decimal number           | Positions, speeds, time: they need fractions      |
| `i32`   | 32-bit signed integer           | Pixel coordinates: can be negative (off-screen)   |
| `u32`   | 32-bit unsigned (never negative)| Score, lives, one packed pixel color              |
| `u8`    | 0 to 255                        | One color channel (red, green or blue)            |
| `usize` | Unsigned, the size of a memory address | Lengths and indexes: `vec[i]` needs a `usize` |
| `u64`   | 64-bit unsigned                 | The frame counter                                 |

Plus `bool` (`true`/`false`), `char` (one Unicode character) and `&str`
(text, see [chapter 6](#strings-string-vs-str)).

### Converting with `as`

Rust **never converts number types for you**. This doesn't compile:

```rust
let width: usize = 320;
let half: f32 = width / 2;
```

```text
error[E0308]: mismatched types
   |     let half: f32 = width / 2;
   |               ---   ^^^^^^^^^ expected `f32`, found `usize`
help: you can cast a `usize` to an `f32`
   |     let half: f32 = (width / 2) as f32;
```

You'll see `as` all over the engine, like in `Canvas::index`:

```rust
if x < 0 || y < 0 || x >= self.width as i32 || y >= self.height as i32 {
```

It's a little noisy, but it forces you to think about every conversion,
and conversions are where many bugs come from. (What does `-1` mean as a
`usize`? Rust makes you decide.)

### Constants

`const` values are fixed forever and must have a written type. By
convention they're in `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`. The top of
`examples/breakout.rs` is full of them:

```rust
const PADDLE_WIDTH: f32 = 48.0;
const PADDLE_SPEED: f32 = 240.0;
const BALL_START_SPEED: f32 = 150.0;
```

Collecting the "tuning knobs" at the top of a file like this makes a game
easy to tweak. Try changing them!

## 3. Functions and expressions

A function lists its parameter types and, after `->`, its return type:

```rust
/// Shorthand for [`Vec2::new`]: `vec2(1.0, 2.0)`.
pub const fn vec2(x: f32, y: f32) -> Vec2 {
    Vec2 { x, y }
}
```

Two things to notice:

1. **There's no `return`.** In Rust, a block's value is its last
   *expression*, a line **without a semicolon**. `Vec2 { x, y }` is the
   last expression, so it's the return value. Adding a `;` would turn it
   into a statement that returns nothing, and the compiler would complain.
2. **`Vec2 { x, y }`** is shorthand for `Vec2 { x: x, y: y }`, used when
   the variables have the same names as the fields.

Comments starting with `///` are **doc comments**. They show up in
`cargo doc` and when you hover in your editor.

### `if` is an expression too

Since `if` produces a value, there's no need for a `? :` operator. From
`Canvas::draw_line`:

```rust
let step_x = if x < x_end { 1 } else { -1 };
```

And from `Vec2::normalized`:

```rust
pub fn normalized(self) -> Self {
    let len = self.length();
    if len == 0.0 {
        Self::ZERO
    } else {
        self * (1.0 / len)
    }
}
```

The whole `if`/`else` is the last expression, so its value is returned.

You can still leave a function early with `return`, as in `Canvas::index`:

```rust
fn index(&self, x: i32, y: i32) -> Option<usize> {
    if x < 0 || y < 0 || x >= self.width as i32 || y >= self.height as i32 {
        return None;
    }
    Some(y as usize * self.width + x as usize)
}
```

## 4. Structs and methods

A **struct** groups related data. Here's `Vec2` from `src/math.rs`:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Default)]
pub struct Vec2 {
    pub x: f32,
    pub y: f32,
}
```

(The `#[derive(...)]` line is explained in [chapter 8](#derive-free-trait-implementations).)

A game's whole state is usually one struct. Here's Breakout's:

```rust
struct Breakout {
    state: State,
    paddle: Rect,
    ball: Rect,
    ball_velocity: Vec2,
    ball_speed: f32,
    bricks: Vec<Brick>,
    particles: Vec<Particle>,
    score: u32,
    lives: u32,
}
```

### Methods live in `impl` blocks

```rust
impl Vec2 {
    pub const ZERO: Vec2 = vec2(0.0, 0.0);

    pub const fn new(x: f32, y: f32) -> Self {
        Self { x, y }
    }

    pub fn length(self) -> f32 {
        (self.x * self.x + self.y * self.y).sqrt()
    }
}
```

- `Self` means "the type this `impl` is for", here `Vec2`.
- `new` has no `self` parameter, so it's an **associated function**, called
  with `::` like `Vec2::new(1.0, 2.0)`. Rust has no constructors; a function
  called `new` is just a convention.
- `length` takes `self`, so it's a **method**, called with a dot:
  `velocity.length()`.

### `self`, `&self` and `&mut self`

The first parameter of a method says how it uses the value. This is one of
the most important things to understand in Rust:

| Parameter   | Meaning                                          | Example                            |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `&self`     | Borrows the value to **read** it                 | `Rect::overlaps(&self, other: &Rect)` |
| `&mut self` | Borrows the value to **change** it               | `Canvas::clear(&mut self, color: Color)` |
| `self`      | Takes the value itself (ownership moves in)      | `Vec2::length(self)`               |

`Vec2::length` can take `self` cheaply because `Vec2` is `Copy` (it's just
two numbers), so calling it copies the vector. [Chapter 6](#6-ownership-and-borrowing)
explains what all of this really means.

### Private fields and getters

`Vec2`'s fields are `pub`, so anyone can read or write `v.x`. `Canvas`'s
fields are *not* `pub`:

```rust
pub struct Canvas {
    width: usize,
    height: usize,
    pixels: Vec<u32>,
}
```

Outside `canvas.rs` you can only read the size through `canvas.width()`.
Why? If a game could set `canvas.width = 1000` without resizing `pixels`,
every drawing function would index out of bounds. Keeping the fields
private makes that mistake impossible.

### Struct update syntax and destructuring

Every example creates its `Config` like this:

```rust
let config = Config {
    title: String::from("Hello, duckforge"),
    ..Config::default()
};
```

`..Config::default()` means "take every field I didn't list from
`Config::default()`".

You can also pull a struct apart into variables. From `Canvas::draw_rect`:

```rust
let Rect { x, y, w, h } = rect;
```

### Builder methods: chaining settings

The physics engine creates bodies like this:

```rust
let ball = Body::ball(vec2(160.0, 20.0), 8.0).with_bounce(0.6).with_friction(0.1);
let wall = Body::block(vec2(0.0, 100.0), vec2(10.0, 200.0)).fixed();
```

Each `with_...` method takes the body **by value** (`mut self`), changes
it, and hands it back:

```rust
pub fn with_bounce(mut self, bounce: f32) -> Self {
    self.bounce = bounce;
    self
}
```

That's what lets the calls chain one after another. This is called the
*builder pattern*: you mention only the settings you care about, and
everything else keeps a sensible default.

### Newtypes

`PhysicsWorld::add` gives you back a `BodyId`, which is just a number in
disguise:

```rust
pub struct BodyId(usize);
```

A struct with unnamed fields is a *tuple struct*. Wrapping a single value
like this is called a **newtype**. Why not just return a `usize`? Because
then you could accidentally pass a score or an array index where a body id
belongs. As its own type, that mix-up won't compile. And because the field
isn't `pub`, games can't make up fake ids either.

## 5. Enums and pattern matching

An **enum** is a type whose value is exactly *one* of several variants.
Breakout's game state:

```rust
enum State {
    Serving,
    Playing,
    Paused,
    GameOver,
    Won,
}
```

The game can never be "sort of paused and sort of game over". With separate
`bool` flags like `is_paused` and `is_game_over` that bug would be possible.
With an enum it can't happen.

### `match`

`match` runs the arm that fits the value. Breakout's `update` is built
around one:

```rust
match self.state {
    State::Serving => {
        self.move_paddle(ctx);
        self.put_ball_on_paddle();
        if ctx.input.was_pressed(Key::Space) {
            self.launch_ball(&mut ctx.rng);
        }
    }
    State::Playing => { /* ... */ }
    State::Paused => { /* ... */ }
    State::GameOver | State::Won => { /* ... */ } // `|` matches either
}
```

**`match` must cover every variant.** If you add a new state and forget to
handle it, the program won't compile:

```text
error[E0004]: non-exhaustive patterns: `State::Paused` not covered
```

This is great when a program grows: add a variant, then let the compiler
show you every place that needs updating.

To deliberately ignore the rest, use the `_` wildcard. `convert_key` in
`src/engine.rs` translates the keys games can use and ignores the rest
(like Num Lock):

```rust
use minifb::Key as K;

let key = match key {
    K::A => Key::A,
    K::B => Key::B,
    // ...
    _ => return None,
};
```

(`use minifb::Key as K;` imports minifb's `Key` under a short nickname,
because our own type is *also* called `Key`. Without it, every one of the
~65 lines would start with `minifb::Key::`.)

`match` is also an expression that returns a value. From `draw_hud`:

```rust
let (title, hint) = match self.state {
    State::Playing => return, // nothing to show while playing
    State::Serving => ("", "PRESS SPACE TO LAUNCH"),
    State::Paused => ("PAUSED", "PRESS P TO CONTINUE"),
    State::GameOver => ("GAME OVER", "PRESS SPACE TO TRY AGAIN"),
    State::Won => ("YOU WIN!", "PRESS SPACE TO PLAY AGAIN"),
};
```

Each arm gives back a *tuple* of two strings, which `let (title, hint)`
unpacks.

### Enums can carry data: `Option`

Variants can hold values. The most important enum in Rust is in the
standard library:

```rust
enum Option<T> {
    Some(T), // there is a value, of type T
    None,    // there is no value
}
```

**Rust has no `null`.** When something might be missing, its type says so.
`Canvas::get_pixel` returns `Option<Color>` because the coordinates might be
off the canvas:

```rust
pub fn get_pixel(&self, x: i32, y: i32) -> Option<Color>
```

You *can't* use an `Option<Color>` as a `Color` by accident; you have to
deal with `None` first. The engine shows several ways to do that:

```rust
// if let: run code only when there is a value
if let Some(i) = self.index(x, y) {
    self.pixels[i] = color.to_u32();
}

// map: transform the value inside, if there is one
self.index(x, y).map(|i| Color::from_hex(self.pixels[i]))

// unwrap_or: use a fallback when there's no value
let longest = text.lines().map(|line| line.chars().count()).max().unwrap_or(0);

// let-else: take the value, or leave the function
let Some(index) = self.bricks.iter().position(|brick| brick.rect.overlaps(&self.ball)) else {
    return false;
};
```

There's also `.unwrap()`, which takes the value and **crashes the program
if it's `None`**. It's fine in tests and quick experiments. In real code,
prefer the forms above.

## 6. Ownership and borrowing

This is the chapter that makes Rust *Rust*. Take your time with it.

Most languages manage memory in one of two ways: you free it by hand (C,
C++), which is fast but causes crashes and security holes when you get it
wrong; or a *garbage collector* frees it for you (Java, Python, C#), which
is safe but costs performance and causes pauses. Rust does neither. Instead
the compiler follows a few rules that decide, at compile time, exactly when
each value is freed.

### The rules of ownership

1. Every value has exactly one **owner** (a variable, a struct field, ...).
2. When the owner goes away, the value is freed.
3. Ownership can be **moved** to a new owner. The old owner can't be used
   any more.

```rust
let name = String::from("Breakout");
let title = name;      // ownership moves from `name` to `title`
println!("{}", name);  // error!
```

```text
error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `name`
   |     let name = String::from("Breakout");
   |         ---- move occurs because `name` has type `String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
   |     let title = name;
   |                 ---- value moved here
   |     println!("{}", name);
   |                    ^^^^ value borrowed here after move
help: consider cloning the value if the performance cost is acceptable
```

Why? If both variables owned the same text, it would be freed twice when
they both went away. Rust's answer: only one owner at a time.

You can see a move in every example's `main`:

```rust
duckforge::run(config, Breakout::new())
```

`run` takes the game *by value*, so the engine now owns your game for as long
as it runs. The game is freed when `run` finishes.

Another move is in Breakout, where a brick is destroyed:

```rust
let brick = self.bricks.remove(index);
self.score += brick.points;
```

`Vec::remove` moves the brick out of the vector and gives it to us. It's
freed at the end of the function, after we've used its points, color and
position.

### `Copy` types

Small, simple values like numbers are **copied** instead of moved, so the
old variable stays usable:

```rust
let a = 5;
let b = a; // copies
println!("{a}"); // fine
```

Our own types can opt in with `#[derive(Clone, Copy)]`. `Vec2`, `Rect` and
`Color` do, because they're just a few numbers and copying them costs
nothing. That's why you can write `let pos = self.position;` freely.

`Canvas` is **not** `Copy`: it owns a `Vec` of 76,800 pixels. Copying it
by accident on every function call would be slow, so Rust makes copying
explicit (you'd have to call `.clone()`, and `Canvas` doesn't even offer
that).

### Borrowing: `&` and `&mut`

Moving everything around would be exhausting, so usually you **borrow**
instead. A borrow is a *reference*: a pointer the compiler checks for
you.

- `&value` is a **shared borrow**: you can read, not change.
- `&mut value` is a **mutable borrow**: you can change it.

**The borrowing rule:** at any moment you can have *either* any number of
`&` borrows, *or* exactly one `&mut` borrow. Never both.

Look at the heart of the game loop in `src/engine.rs`:

```rust
game.update(&mut ctx);
game.draw(&mut canvas);
```

And the `Game` trait:

```rust
fn update(&mut self, ctx: &mut Context);
fn draw(&self, canvas: &mut Canvas);
```

- `update` gets `&mut self` (it can change the game) and `&mut Context`
  (it can use the random number generator or ask to quit).
- `draw` gets `&self` (it can only *look* at the game) and `&mut Canvas`
  (it can draw). If you try to change the score in `draw`, it won't
  compile. The type signature is a promise that the compiler enforces.

### Why the rule exists

Here's a bug that's easy to write in many languages: changing a list while
you're looping over it. Rust catches it at compile time. Try this:

```rust
impl Game {
    fn add_points(&mut self, n: u32) {
        self.score += n;
    }

    fn update(&mut self) {
        for brick in &self.bricks {   // shared borrow of self.bricks...
            if brick.alive {
                self.add_points(10);  // ...but this needs `&mut self`!
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```text
error[E0502]: cannot borrow `*self` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
  |         for brick in &self.bricks {
  |                      ------------
  |                      |
  |                      immutable borrow occurs here
  |                      immutable borrow later used here
  |             if brick.alive {
  |                 self.add_points(10);
  |                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ mutable borrow occurs here
```

`add_points` takes `&mut self`, so it *could* change `self.bricks` while
the loop is walking over it. The compiler can't know it won't, so it says
no. Two ways to fix it:

1. **Touch the field directly.** `self.score += 10;` compiles fine inside
   the loop, because the compiler can see that `self.score` and
   `self.bricks` are *different fields*.
2. **Split the work into two steps**: first find what you need with a
   shared borrow, then change things once that borrow has ended.

Breakout uses the second approach in `break_brick_under_ball`:

```rust
// Step 1: a shared borrow, just to find the index. It ends on this line.
let Some(index) = self
    .bricks
    .iter()
    .position(|brick| brick.rect.overlaps(&self.ball))
else {
    return false;
};

// Step 2: now we're free to change things.
let brick = self.bricks.remove(index);
self.score += brick.points;
// ...
self.spawn_particles(brick.rect.center(), brick.color, rng);
```

When you fight the borrow checker, this "find first, change second"
pattern is usually the answer.

### Ask for only what you need

`break_brick_under_ball` needs random numbers for the particles. It could
take the whole `&mut Context`, but it takes just `rng: &mut Rng`:

```rust
fn break_brick_under_ball(&mut self, rng: &mut Rng) -> bool
```

and is called with `self.break_brick_under_ball(&mut ctx.rng)`. You can
borrow one field of a struct on its own. Asking for less makes a function
easier to understand and easier to call.

### A real borrow error, from building this engine

While writing the physics sandbox, I wrote this:

```rust
fn update(&mut self, ctx: &mut Context) {
    let input = &ctx.input;
    if input.was_pressed(Key::Escape) {
        ctx.quit();
    }
    if input.was_pressed(Key::C) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

and the compiler stopped me:

```text
error[E0502]: cannot borrow `*ctx` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
   |
 7 |         let input = &ctx.input;
   |                     ---------- immutable borrow occurs here
 8 |         if input.was_pressed(Key::Escape) {
 9 |             ctx.quit();
   |             ^^^^^^^^^^ mutable borrow occurs here
10 |         }
11 |         if input.was_pressed(Key::C) {
   |            ----- immutable borrow later used here
```

`input` borrows part of `ctx`, and it's still in use on line 11, so from
line 7 to line 11 `ctx` is being read. But `ctx.quit()` needs `&mut` access
to *all* of `ctx`, which could change `ctx.input` while `input` is looking
at it. The fix was to drop the `input` variable and write
`ctx.input.was_pressed(...)` each time, so each borrow only lasts for its
own line.

Notice that the message points at *three* places: where the borrow starts,
where the conflict is, and where the borrow is used later. Reading all
three usually shows you the fix.

### Two mutable borrows into one list

The physics engine often needs to change two bodies at once (when they
collide), and both live in the same `Vec`. The obvious code doesn't
compile:

```rust
let a = &mut bodies[i];
let b = &mut bodies[j];
```

```text
error[E0499]: cannot borrow `bodies` as mutable more than once at a time
  |     let a = &mut bodies[i];
  |                  ------ first mutable borrow occurs here
  |     let b = &mut bodies[j];
  |                  ^^^^^^ second mutable borrow occurs here
  = help: use `.split_at_mut(position)` to obtain two mutable non-overlapping sub-slices
```

Even when `i` and `j` are different, the compiler only sees two `&mut`
borrows of `bodies`. And it tells you the fix: `split_at_mut` cuts a slice
into two halves that *can't* overlap. From `src/physics.rs`:

```rust
fn pair_mut<V>(bodies: &mut [Option<Body<V>>], i: usize, j: usize) -> (&mut Body<V>, &mut Body<V>) {
    assert!(i < j);
    let (left, right) = bodies.split_at_mut(j);
    let a = left[i].as_mut().expect("contact refers to a removed body");
    let b = right[0].as_mut().expect("contact refers to a removed body");
    (a, b)
}
```

`left` holds items `0..j` and `right` holds `j..`, so `bodies[j]` is
`right[0]`.

### `std::mem::take`

Sometimes you want to move a value *out* of something you only have a
`&mut` to. `ButtonState::begin_frame` in `src/input.rs` does this:

```rust
self.down_last_frame = std::mem::take(&mut self.down);
self.down.extend(held);
```

`mem::take` moves the set out of `self.down` and leaves an empty set
behind. Nothing is copied, and `self.down` is never left invalid.

### Strings: `String` vs `&str`

- `String` is **owned** text. It lives on the heap and can grow.
  `String::from("hi")` and `format!("SCORE {}", score)` create one.
- `&str` is a **borrowed** view of some text. String literals like
  `"GAME OVER"` are `&str`.

Functions that only read text should take `&str`, like `draw_text`:

```rust
pub fn draw_text(&mut self, text: &str, pos: Vec2, scale: u32, color: Color)
```

Then it accepts both kinds:

```rust
canvas.draw_text("HELLO, RUST!", vec2(8.0, 8.0), 2, Color::WHITE); // a &str literal
let lives = format!("LIVES {}", self.lives);                        // a String
canvas.draw_text(&lives, vec2(x, 4.0), 1, Color::WHITE);            // borrowed as &str
```

The same idea applies to arrays: `Vec<u32>` owns its items, while `&[u32]` (a
*slice*) borrows some of them. `Canvas::pixels` lends out the pixels
without giving away ownership:

```rust
pub fn pixels(&self) -> &[u32] {
    &self.pixels
}
```

### A word on lifetimes

The compiler tracks how long every borrow lives, and never lets a
reference outlive the value it points to. In `pixels()` above, it knows the
returned slice borrows from `self`, so the canvas can't be freed or
changed while someone is still holding that slice. Sometimes you have to
spell these relationships out with *lifetime annotations* like `<'a>`.
This engine never needed one, and small programs rarely do.

## 7. Collections, loops, closures and iterators

### `Vec<T>`: a growable list

```rust
let mut bricks = Vec::with_capacity(rows * BRICK_COLUMNS); // empty, with room reserved
bricks.push(Brick { /* ... */ });                          // add to the end
let brick = self.bricks.remove(index);                     // take one out
if self.bricks.is_empty() { /* ... */ }                    // check if empty
let pixels = vec![0; width * height];                      // `width * height` zeros
self.pixels[i] = color.to_u32();                           // index (panics if out of range)
```

`Input` keeps the held keys in a `HashSet`, a collection with no duplicates
and a fast `contains` check, which is exactly what "which keys are held?"
needs.

The examples use two more collections from `std::collections`:

- `HashMap<K, V>` looks up a value by a key. The 3D playground uses one to
  remember how each physics body should be drawn (`BodyId` to `Look`).
- `VecDeque<T>` is a list that's fast to change at *both* ends. The physics
  sandbox adds new balls at the back and, when there are too many, removes
  the oldest from the front.

### Loops

```rust
for column in 0..BRICK_COLUMNS { }   // 0, 1, ..., BRICK_COLUMNS - 1
for c in 'A'..='Z' { }               // ..= includes the end
for brick in &self.bricks { }        // borrow each item to read it
for particle in &mut self.particles { } // borrow each item to change it
for (row, &color) in ROW_COLORS.iter().enumerate() { } // with an index
while window.is_open() { }           // the game loop
loop { /* ... */ break; }            // forever, until `break` (see draw_line)
```

### Closures

A **closure** is a small function without a name, written `|args| body`.
It can use variables from around it. From `Color::lerp`:

```rust
pub fn lerp(self, other: Color, t: f32) -> Color {
    let t = t.clamp(0.0, 1.0);
    let mix = |a: u8, b: u8| (a as f32 + (b as f32 - a as f32) * t).round() as u8;
    Color::rgb(
        mix(self.r, other.r),
        mix(self.g, other.g),
        mix(self.b, other.b),
    )
}
```

`mix` uses `t` from the surrounding function without it being passed in.

### Iterators

Iterators let you describe *what* you want from a collection instead of
writing loops by hand. `Canvas::text_width` finds the length of the longest
line of text:

```rust
let longest = text
    .lines()                          // each line of the text
    .map(|line| line.chars().count()) // ...turned into its length
    .max()                            // the biggest one (an Option: text might be empty)
    .unwrap_or(0);                    // 0 if there were no lines
```

More iterator methods in the engine:

| Method                | What it does                                  | Where                         |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `.position(\|x\| ...)` | Index of the first match, as an `Option`      | `break_brick_under_ball`      |
| `.filter_map(f)`      | Transform each item, dropping the `None`s     | reading keys in `run`         |
| `.enumerate()`        | Pairs each item with its index                | `build_bricks`                |
| `.all(\|x\| ...)`      | Are all items true?                           | a canvas test                 |
| `.chain(other)`       | One iterator, then another                    | a font test                   |

Iterators are *lazy*: nothing happens until something like `max`, a `for`
loop or `collect` asks for items. They compile down to code as fast as a
hand-written loop.

`Vec::retain` is a handy relative. It keeps only the items that pass a
test. That's how dead particles are removed:

```rust
self.particles.retain(|particle| particle.life > 0.0);
```

## 8. Traits

A **trait** describes behavior that different types can share. It's like
an *interface* in other languages. The engine's most important trait is
`Game`, in `src/engine.rs`:

```rust
pub trait Game {
    fn update(&mut self, ctx: &mut Context);
    fn draw(&self, canvas: &mut Canvas);
}
```

Any type that implements these two methods is a game. From `examples/hello.rs`:

```rust
struct Hello {
    position: Vec2,
}

impl Game for Hello {
    fn update(&mut self, ctx: &mut Context) { /* ... */ }
    fn draw(&self, canvas: &mut Canvas) { /* ... */ }
}
```

### Generics: code that works for any `Game`

```rust
pub fn run<G: Game>(config: Config, mut game: G) -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>>
```

`<G: Game>` reads as "for any type `G` that implements `Game`". The engine
doesn't know about `Hello` or `Breakout`, but it can run both. The compiler
creates a separate copy of `run` for each game type ("monomorphization"),
so calling `game.update(...)` is as fast as a normal function call.

A similar shortcut is `impl Trait` in a parameter:

```rust
pub(crate) fn begin_frame(&mut self, keys_down: impl IntoIterator<Item = Key>)
```

"Give me anything that can be turned into an iterator of `Key`s." The game
loop passes an iterator; the tests pass a plain array like `[Key::Space]`.
Both work.

`Canvas::write_bmp` does the same with `out: &mut impl Write`. When saving
a screenshot, it writes to a file. In the test, it writes to a `Vec<u8>` in
memory, so the test can check the bytes without touching the disk.

### Generic types: one physics engine for 2D and 3D

Structs can be generic too, not just functions. The physics engine has to
work with `Vec2` in 2D games and with `Vec3` in 3D ones. Instead of writing
it twice, it's written once for "any vector type `V`":

```rust
pub struct PhysicsWorld<V> {
    pub gravity: V,
    bodies: Vec<Option<Body<V>>>,
    contacts: Vec<Contact<V>>,
}
```

But the physics code has to *do* things with `V`: add vectors, take dot
products, read the x component. So `src/math.rs` defines a trait that says
what a vector can do:

```rust
pub trait Vector:
    Copy
    + Debug
    + Default
    + PartialEq
    + Add<Output = Self>
    + Sub<Output = Self>
    + Mul<f32, Output = Self>
    + Neg<Output = Self>
    + AddAssign
    + SubAssign
{
    const DIMENSIONS: usize;

    fn get(self, axis: usize) -> f32;
    fn with(self, axis: usize, value: f32) -> Self;
    fn dot(self, other: Self) -> f32;

    fn unit(axis: usize) -> Self {
        Self::default().with(axis, 1.0)
    }
}
```

Four new ideas in one place:

- **Supertraits.** The list after `Vector:` means "to be a `Vector`, a type
  must *also* implement all of these". So code that has a `V: Vector` can
  use `+`, `-` and `* 2.0` on it.
- **Associated constants.** Each type fills in `DIMENSIONS`: 2 or 3. The
  box collision test loops `for axis in 0..V::DIMENSIONS`, so the same loop
  checks 2 axes in 2D and 3 axes in 3D.
- **Default methods.** `unit` has a body, so every implementor gets it for free.
- **`impl<V: Vector>`.** The methods are written
  `impl<V: Vector> PhysicsWorld<V> { ... }`: "for any `V` that is a `Vector`".

And you rarely have to write `V` yourself, because Rust works it out from
the gravity you pass in:

```rust
let world_2d = PhysicsWorld::new(vec2(0.0, 500.0));     // a PhysicsWorld<Vec2>
let world_3d = PhysicsWorld::new(vec3(0.0, -9.8, 0.0)); // a PhysicsWorld<Vec3>
```

`src/input.rs` uses the same idea on a smaller scale. `ButtonState<T>`
tracks "held this frame / held last frame" for any kind of button, and
`Input` has one for keys (`ButtonState<Key>`) and one for mouse buttons
(`ButtonState<MouseButton>`).

### Operator overloading

Implementing standard library traits lets your types work with operators.
Because `src/math.rs` implements `Add` for `Vec2`:

```rust
impl Add for Vec2 {
    type Output = Vec2;
    fn add(self, rhs: Vec2) -> Vec2 {
        vec2(self.x + rhs.x, self.y + rhs.y)
    }
}
```

you can write `a + b` with vectors. `Sub`, `Mul<f32>`, `Neg`, `AddAssign` and
`SubAssign` give us `-`, `* 2.0`, unary `-` and `+=`/`-=`. That's what makes
this line in `hello.rs` read like the math it is:

```rust
self.position += direction * SPEED * ctx.dt();
```

`type Output = Vec2;` is an *associated type*: it says what `a + b`
produces.

### `Default`

`Config` implements `Default` by hand, which lets examples write
`..Config::default()`:

```rust
impl Default for Config {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Self {
            title: String::from("duckforge"),
            width: 320,
            height: 240,
            scale: 3,
            target_fps: 60,
        }
    }
}
```

### `derive`: free trait implementations

For common traits, the compiler can write the implementation for you:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]
pub enum Key { /* ... */ }
```

| Trait              | Gives you                                              |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `Debug`            | Printing with `{:?}`, e.g. `println!("{:?}", key)`     |
| `Clone`            | An explicit `.clone()` method                          |
| `Copy`             | Implicit copying instead of moving ([chapter 6](#copy-types)) |
| `PartialEq`, `Eq`  | Comparing with `==`                                    |
| `Hash`             | Can be stored in a `HashSet` or used as a `HashMap` key |
| `Default`          | A `::default()` value with every field zeroed/empty    |

`Key` needs `Hash` and `Eq` because `Input` keeps keys in a `HashSet`.
`Vec2` derives `PartialEq` but not `Eq`, because floats can be `NaN`,
which isn't equal to itself.

### Dynamic dispatch (for later)

`run<G: Game>` picks the game type at compile time. To pick at runtime, say
to hold a list of different scenes, you'd use a *trait object* like
`Box<dyn Game>`. The standard library does this for errors: we return
`Box<dyn Error>`, which can hold any type of error. You won't need your own
trait objects for a while.

## 9. Modules and visibility

`src/lib.rs` declares the modules. Each `mod name;` line loads `src/name.rs`:

```rust
pub mod canvas;
pub mod color;
pub mod engine;
#[cfg(feature = "gpu")]
mod gpu;
pub mod input;
pub mod math;
pub mod physics;
pub mod render3d;
pub mod rng;

// Not `pub`: the font is an internal detail of `Canvas::draw_text`.
mod font;
```

`#[cfg(feature = "gpu")]` means "only compile the next item when the `gpu`
feature is on". Without the feature, `gpu.rs` isn't even compiled, and
neither is any line marked the same way elsewhere (like the GPU field in
`Canvas`).

**Everything is private by default.** You choose what to share:

| Written as     | Visible to                                           | Example                        |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| (nothing)      | The current module (and modules inside it)           | `Canvas::index`, `mod font`    |
| `pub(crate)`   | Anywhere inside this crate, but not to games using it | `Context::begin_frame`         |
| `pub`          | Everyone                                             | `Canvas::fill_rect`            |

`Context::begin_frame` is `pub(crate)` because only the engine's loop should
advance the clock. A game calling it would mess up its own timing, so we
make that impossible.

Inside the crate, modules refer to each other with `crate::`:

```rust
use crate::color::Color;
use crate::math::{Rect, Vec2, vec2};
```

### The prelude pattern

Games would need a long list of `use` lines without this, at the bottom of
`lib.rs`:

```rust
pub mod prelude {
    pub use crate::canvas::Canvas;
    pub use crate::color::Color;
    pub use crate::engine::{Config, Context, Game};
    pub use crate::input::{Input, Key, MouseButton};
    pub use crate::math::{Rect, Vec2, Vec3, vec2, vec3};
    pub use crate::render3d::{Camera3D, Mesh, Renderer, Transform};
    pub use crate::rng::Rng;
}
```

`pub use` re-exports a name, so `use duckforge::prelude::*;` brings all of
them in at once. Many Rust libraries do this. (The physics types aren't in
the prelude, so games that use physics also write
`use duckforge::physics::{Body, PhysicsWorld};`.)

### One type, several files

`Canvas` is defined in `src/canvas.rs`, but its `draw_mesh` method lives in
`src/render3d.rs`:

```rust
impl Canvas {
    pub fn draw_mesh(&mut self, mesh: &Mesh, transform: &Transform, camera: &Camera3D) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

A type can have any number of `impl` blocks, in any module of the same
crate. That keeps all the 3D code in one file, while games still simply
write `canvas.draw_mesh(...)`. `draw_mesh` needs the canvas's private depth
buffer, so `canvas.rs` offers `fill_triangle_3d` as `pub(crate)`: usable
from `render3d.rs`, invisible to games.

## 10. Error handling

Rust has two kinds of errors.

**Unrecoverable errors: `panic!`.** A bug that should never happen, like an
out-of-range index, stops the program with a message. Integer overflow
panics too in debug builds. So does `.unwrap()` on a `None`. The physics
engine panics on purpose if you call `.with_mass(0.0)`: a zero mass is a
bug in the calling code, and a clear message right away beats strange
behavior later.

**Recoverable errors: `Result`.** When something can fail for reasons
outside your control (no display, disk full), a function returns:

```rust
enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),  // it worked, here's the value
    Err(E), // it failed, here's why
}
```

### The `?` operator

Opening a window can fail. In `run`:

```rust
let mut window = Window::new(
    &config.title,
    config.width * config.scale,
    config.height * config.scale,
    options,
)?;
```

That `?` at the end means: *if this is an `Err`, return the error from
this function right now; otherwise give me the value inside the `Ok`.* It
replaces a whole `match`. That only works because `run` returns a `Result`
too:

```rust
pub fn run<G: Game>(config: Config, mut game: G) -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>>
```

`Result<(), ...>` means "nothing useful on success, just that it worked".
`()` is the "empty" type. And `main` can return a `Result` too, so every
example ends like this:

```rust
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // ...
    duckforge::run(config, game)
}
```

If `run` fails, the program exits and prints the error.

`Canvas::save_bmp` is a chain of `?`s, one per write:

```rust
pub fn save_bmp(&self, path: impl AsRef<Path>) -> io::Result<()> {
    let file = File::create(path)?;
    let mut out = BufWriter::new(file);
    self.write_bmp(&mut out)?;
    out.flush()
}
```

### Handling an error instead of passing it on

A failed screenshot shouldn't crash the game, so `save_screenshot` deals
with the error itself:

```rust
match canvas.save_bmp(&path) {
    Ok(()) => println!("Saved {path}"),
    Err(err) => eprintln!("Could not save {path}: {err}"),
}
```

### Design choice: drawing never fails

Drawing off the edge of the canvas is *normal* in games (a particle flies
off-screen, text is too wide). So the canvas quietly clips instead of
panicking or returning a `Result`. There's a test that proves it:

```rust
#[test]
fn drawing_off_canvas_does_not_panic() {
    let mut canvas = Canvas::new(10, 10);
    canvas.set_pixel(-5, 100, Color::WHITE);
    canvas.fill_rect(Rect::new(-50.0, -50.0, 20.0, 20.0), Color::WHITE);
    // ...
}
```

Deciding what's a bug (panic), what's expected failure (`Result`) and
what's not an error at all (clip it) is a big part of designing Rust APIs.

## 11. Tests

Tests live next to the code they test, at the bottom of each file:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn pressed_is_true_for_one_frame_only() {
        let mut input = Input::new();

        input.begin_frame([Key::Space]);
        assert!(input.is_down(Key::Space));
        assert!(input.was_pressed(Key::Space));

        input.begin_frame([Key::Space]);
        assert!(input.is_down(Key::Space));
        assert!(!input.was_pressed(Key::Space));
        // ...
    }
}
```

- `#[cfg(test)]` means "only compile this when testing".
- `use super::*;` imports everything from the parent module. Tests can use
  private items like `begin_frame`, since they're inside the module.
- `#[test]` marks a test function. `assert!(condition)` and
  `assert_eq!(left, right)` fail the test if they're not satisfied.

Run them all with `cargo test`. The code example in the doc comment at the
top of `src/lib.rs` is compiled as a test too (a *doc test*), so the
documentation can't go out of date.

Game logic is hard to test by playing, and easy to test with code. Whenever
you fix a bug, try writing a test that would have caught it.

# Part 2: How the engine works

## 12. The big picture

```text

            |
            v
+------------------------- duckforge --------------------------+

|               <- the ONLY file that knows minifb exists        |
|                                                                |

|  physics.rs   bodies, collisions, bouncing (2D and 3D)         |

            |
            v
        minifb     (opens the window, shows pixels, reports keys and mouse)
            |
            v
     Windows / macOS / Linux
```

Four design decisions shape everything:

1. **A trait is the contract between engine and game.** The engine calls
   `update` and `draw`; the game never has to know how windows work.
2. **Only one file touches the window library.** Games use our own `Key`
   type, not minifb's. To switch to another library (like SDL2 or winit),
   you'd rewrite `engine.rs` and nothing else.
3. **Everything ends up in one `Vec<u32>` of pixels.** 2D is always drawn
   by our own code. 3D is drawn either by our own code on the CPU (so you can
   read every step) or by the graphics card (for big scenes). Either way,
   the result lands in the same pixels, and the window never knows the
   difference.
4. **Physics and drawing don't know about each other.** The physics world
   only moves bodies around; the game draws each body wherever the physics
   put it. You can use either without the other.

## 13. The game loop

Every game engine, from this one to Unreal, is built around a loop that
runs once per frame. Here's ours, from `run` in `src/engine.rs`:

```rust
while window.is_open() && !ctx.quit_requested {
    // 1. Time.
    let now = Instant::now();
    let real_dt = now.duration_since(last_frame).as_secs_f32();
    last_frame = now;

    // 2. Input: translate the window library's keys and buttons into our own types.
    let keys = window.get_keys().into_iter().filter_map(convert_key);
    ctx.begin_frame(real_dt, keys);
    read_mouse(&window, &canvas, &mut ctx.input);

    // 3 + 4. The game's turn.
    game.update(&mut ctx);
    game.draw(&mut canvas);
    canvas.flush_3d(); // make sure any 3D from the graphics card is in the pixels
    if ctx.renderer_name != canvas.renderer_name() {
        ctx.renderer_name = canvas.renderer_name().to_string();
    }

    if ctx.input.was_pressed(Key::F3) {
        show_fps = !show_fps;
    }
    if show_fps {
        draw_fps(&mut canvas, ctx.fps());
    }
    if ctx.input.was_pressed(Key::F12) {
        save_screenshot(&canvas);
    }

    // 5. Show the frame. This also collects new keyboard and mouse events from the OS.
    window.update_with_buffer(canvas.pixels(), canvas.width(), canvas.height())?;
}
```

At 60 frames per second, this whole thing runs every 16.7 milliseconds.

### Delta time (`dt`): frame-rate independence

`dt` is how many seconds passed since the last frame. Games multiply every
speed by it:

```rust
self.position += direction * SPEED * ctx.dt();
```

Why? Say `SPEED` is 120 pixels per second:

| Frame rate | `dt`   | Moved per frame | Moved per second |
|------------|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| 60 fps     | 1/60 s | 2 pixels        | 120 pixels       |
| 30 fps     | 1/30 s | 4 pixels        | 120 pixels       |

Without `dt`, the game would run twice as fast on a computer that draws
twice as many frames. (Some very old games really did this!)

### Capping `dt`

```rust
const MAX_DT: f32 = 1.0 / 30.0;
```

If the game freezes for half a second (you're dragging the window, say),
the next `dt` would be 0.5, and a ball moving 280 px/s would jump 140
pixels in one step, straight through the paddle. This is called
**tunneling**. Capping `dt` means the game briefly runs in slow motion
instead, which players barely notice. (`Context::begin_frame` applies the
cap with `self.dt = real_dt.min(MAX_DT);`. The FPS counter uses the real,
uncapped time.)

### Frame pacing

`window.set_target_fps(60)` makes `update_with_buffer` wait a little each
frame, so the loop doesn't run thousands of times per second and burn a
whole CPU core for nothing.

> in exact steps of, say, 1/60 s, running 0, 1 or 2 updates per drawn
> frame. That makes physics perfectly repeatable. It's a nice exercise;
> search for "Fix Your Timestep" by Glenn Fiedler.

## 14. Pixels and the framebuffer

The canvas is a single flat `Vec<u32>` with one number per pixel, stored row
after row:

```text
          x=0  x=1  x=2  x=3
   y=0  [  0 ][  1 ][  2 ][  3 ]
   y=1  [  4 ][  5 ][  6 ][  7 ]     index = y * width + x
   y=2  [  8 ][  9 ][ 10 ][ 11 ]     so (2, 1) is at 1 * 4 + 2 = 6

   in memory: [0 1 2 3 | 4 5 6 7 | 8 9 10 11]
```

Each `u32` packs a color as `0x00RRGGBB`. `Color::to_u32` builds it with bit
shifts:

```rust
pub const fn to_u32(self) -> u32 {
    ((self.r as u32) << 16) | ((self.g as u32) << 8) | self.b as u32
}
```

```text
 bits:  00000000 RRRRRRRR GGGGGGGG BBBBBBBB
                 ^ r << 16 ^ g << 8 ^ b
```

`<<` shifts bits left, and `|` combines them.

**Scaling:** the canvas is 320x240 but the window opens at 960x720 (`scale:
3`). minifb stretches the small image to fill the window, which gives the
chunky pixel-art look for free. The window keeps the right shape if you
resize it (`ScaleMode::AspectRatioStretch`).

## 15. Drawing shapes and text

All drawing is in `src/canvas.rs`. Every function follows one rule: **never
write outside the pixel buffer**. Indexing out of range would panic.

### Rectangles

```rust
pub fn fill_rect(&mut self, rect: Rect, color: Color) {
    // Round to whole pixels, then clamp to the canvas so we never index out of bounds.
    let clamp_x = |v: f32| (v.round() as i32).clamp(0, self.width as i32) as usize;
    let clamp_y = |v: f32| (v.round() as i32).clamp(0, self.height as i32) as usize;
    let (x0, x1) = (clamp_x(rect.left()), clamp_x(rect.right()));
    let (y0, y1) = (clamp_y(rect.top()), clamp_y(rect.bottom()));
    if x0 >= x1 || y0 >= y1 {
        return; // nothing visible
    }

    let c = color.to_u32();
    for y in y0..y1 {
        let row = y * self.width;
        self.pixels[row + x0..row + x1].fill(c);
    }
}
```

Clamping the corners to the canvas is called **clipping**. Then each row of
the rectangle is one contiguous stretch of memory, so we fill it as a
*slice* in one go. That's much faster than setting pixels one at a time.
This is the most-used function in the engine: the font is drawn with it,
too.

### Circles

For every pixel in the circle's bounding box, check if the pixel's center
is within `radius` of the circle's center (Pythagoras: `dx² + dy² <= r²`):

```rust
let dx = x as f32 + 0.5 - center.x;
let dy = y as f32 + 0.5 - center.y;
if dx * dx + dy * dy <= r2 {
    self.set_pixel(x, y, color);
}
```

Comparing squared distances avoids a slow square root.

### Lines

`draw_line` uses **Bresenham's algorithm** (1962!). It walks from one end
to the other, one pixel at a time, keeping an `error` counter of how far
the drawn pixels have drifted from the true line. When the error gets too
big it takes a step sideways. It uses only integer addition, which mattered
a lot on 1960s hardware.

### Triangles

`fill_triangle` matters most of all, because everything in 3D is made of
triangles. It uses **edge functions**. For the edge from `a` to `b`, this
number is positive for points on one side of the line and negative on the
other:

```rust
fn edge(a: Vec2, b: Vec2, p: Vec2) -> f32 {
    (b.x - a.x) * (p.y - a.y) - (b.y - a.y) * (p.x - a.x)
}
```

A pixel is inside the triangle when it's on the inner side of all three
edges. Better still, the three edge values divided by the triangle's area
say how close the pixel is to each corner. The 3D renderer uses these
*weights* to blend the corners' depths across the triangle (see
[chapter 20](#20-3d-graphics)).

### Text

`src/font.rs` stores each character as five rows of three bits:

```rust
'A' => [0b010, 0b101, 0b111, 0b101, 0b101],
```

```text
0b010   . # .
0b101   # . #
0b111   # # #
0b101   # . #
0b101   # . #
```

`is_lit` checks one bit with a shift and a mask:

```rust
pub fn is_lit(glyph: &Glyph, col: usize, row: usize) -> bool {
    let bit = GLYPH_WIDTH - 1 - col;
    (glyph[row] >> bit) & 1 == 1
}
```

`draw_text` loops over the characters, and for each lit bit draws a
`scale` x `scale` square with `fill_rect`. That's all a bitmap font is.

### Screenshots

Press **F12** in any game to save a `.bmp` file. BMP is one of the simplest
image formats: a 54-byte header describing the size, then the raw pixels.
`write_bmp` writes each number with `to_le_bytes()` ("little-endian": least
significant byte first), which is what the format requires. Our
`0x00RRGGBB` pixels, written little-endian, come out as the bytes B, G, R,
0, which is exactly BMP's order.

## 16. Keyboard and mouse

Games ask two different questions about keys:

- **"Is it held down?"** For continuous things like moving. → `is_down`
- **"Was it *just* pressed?"** For one-shot things like launching the ball.
  If you used `is_down` for that, holding Space for half a second would
  launch 30 times. → `was_pressed`

The OS only tells us which keys are down *right now*. To detect presses,
`Input` also remembers last frame's keys and compares. This lives in the
generic `ButtonState<T>`, so the mouse buttons get it too:

```rust
fn was_pressed(&self, button: T) -> bool {
    self.down.contains(&button) && !self.down_last_frame.contains(&button)
}
```

Here's what happens when you tap Space:

| Frame | Your finger         | `down`    | `down_last_frame` | `is_down` | `was_pressed` | `was_released` |
|-------|---------------------|-----------|-------------------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| 1     | not touching        | {}        | {}                | false     | false         | false          |
| 2     | presses Space       | {Space}   | {}                | true      | **true**      | false          |
| 3     | still holding       | {Space}   | {Space}           | true      | false         | false          |
| 4     | lets go             | {}        | {Space}           | false     | false         | **true**       |

`axis(negative, positive)` is a convenience that turns two keys into a
number between -1.0 and 1.0, which makes movement code short:

```rust
let direction = ctx.input.axis(Key::Left, Key::Right) + ctx.input.axis(Key::A, Key::D);
```

### The mouse

The mouse works the same way: `is_mouse_down`, `was_mouse_pressed` and
`was_mouse_released` for the buttons, plus `mouse_position()`,
`mouse_delta()` (how far it moved this frame, which the 3D camera uses to
look around) and `scroll()`.

The tricky part is the position. The OS reports the pointer in *window*
pixels, but games draw in *canvas* pixels. The canvas is scaled up to fit
the window and centered, with black bars if their shapes don't match:

```text
   a 1200 x 720 window
  +-------+--------------------------------+-------+
  |  bar  |   canvas: 320 x 240,           |  bar  |
  |  120  |   scaled 3x to 960 x 720       |  120  |
  +-------+--------------------------------+-------+
```

`window_to_canvas` in `src/engine.rs` undoes the centering, then the scaling:

```rust
let scale = (window_w / canvas_w).min(window_h / canvas_h);
let offset_x = (window_w - canvas_w * scale) / 2.0;
let offset_y = (window_h - canvas_h * scale) / 2.0;
Some(vec2(
    (mouse.0 - offset_x) / scale,
    (mouse.1 - offset_y) / scale,
))
```

So a click at window pixel (120, 0) lands on canvas pixel (0, 0), and there's
a test for exactly that case.

Different systems report different amounts per scroll-wheel click (Linux
says 1, Windows says 12), so `scroll()` boils it down to just the direction:
`1.0`, `-1.0` or `0.0`.

## 17. Random numbers

Rust's standard library has no random number generator (the popular `rand`
crate fills that gap), so `src/rng.rs` implements **xorshift32**, a
famously tiny algorithm:

```rust
pub fn next_u32(&mut self) -> u32 {
    let mut x = self.state;
    x ^= x << 13;
    x ^= x >> 17;
    x ^= x << 5;
    self.state = x;
    x
}
```

Three shift-and-XOR steps scramble the bits into a sequence that *looks*
random. It isn't really random: the same **seed** always gives the same
sequence. That's useful for tests (`Rng::new(42)`), for replays and for
debugging. The engine seeds it from the clock so each game is different.

Other methods build on `next_u32`: `next_f32` gives `0.0..1.0`, `range`
scales that to any range, and `chance(0.25)` is true 25% of the time.

## 18. Breakout, piece by piece

Now let's see how a real game uses all of this. Open `examples/breakout.rs`.

### A state machine

The `State` enum and the `match` in `update` form a **state machine**, the
most useful pattern in game programming:

```text
                    ball lost (lives left)
               +--------------------------+
               v                          |
  start --> Serving ----- Space -----> Playing <--- P ---> Paused
               ^                         |   |
               |             ball lost   |   |  last brick
               |         (no lives left) v   v  broken
               |                  GameOver   Won
               |                         |   |
               +---- Space or Enter -----+---+
```

Each state decides what input means and what moves. In `Serving` the
arrows move the paddle and the ball sits on it. In `Paused` nothing moves
except P. Menus, cutscenes, enemy AI: they're all state machines.

### Collisions: rectangle overlap

Everything in Breakout is a `Rect`, and `Rect::overlaps` is the whole
collision system:

```rust
pub fn overlaps(&self, other: &Rect) -> bool {
    self.left() < other.right()
        && self.right() > other.left()
        && self.top() < other.bottom()
        && self.bottom() > other.top()
}
```

Two boxes overlap unless one is entirely to the left, right, above or below
the other. This is called **AABB** (axis-aligned bounding box) collision.

### Which way to bounce?

Knowing the ball hit a brick isn't enough; we need to know *which side* it
hit, to know whether to flip `x` or `y` velocity. The trick is to **move one
axis at a time**:

```rust
let step = self.ball_velocity.x * dt;
self.ball.x += step;
let hit_wall = self.ball.left() < 0.0 || self.ball.right() > WIDTH;
if hit_wall || self.break_brick_under_ball(&mut ctx.rng) {
    self.ball.x -= step; // undo the move...
    self.ball_velocity.x = -self.ball_velocity.x; // ...and bounce
}

let step = self.ball_velocity.y * dt;
self.ball.y += step;
// ... the same for y ...
```

If moving *sideways* caused a hit, it was a side hit: undo the move and
flip `x`. Then do the same for `y`. Notice `hit_wall || ...`: `||` stops
early, so if the ball hit a wall we don't even check the bricks.

### Aiming with the paddle

If the ball always bounced straight back, you couldn't aim. So the bounce
angle depends on where the ball lands on the paddle:

```rust
// -1.0 = left edge, 0.0 = middle, 1.0 = right edge.
let offset = (self.ball.center().x - self.paddle.center().x) / (PADDLE_WIDTH / 2.0);
let angle = offset.clamp(-1.0, 1.0) * MAX_BOUNCE_ANGLE;
self.ball_velocity = direction_from_angle(angle) * self.ball_speed;
```

```text
   offset: -1.0            0.0             +1.0
              \             |             /
               \            |            /      bounce angle grows with
                \           |           /       distance from the middle
          [=============== paddle ===============]
```

`direction_from_angle` uses a little trigonometry: `sin(angle)` gives the
sideways part and `-cos(angle)` the upward part (negative because screen `y`
grows *downward*). The result is a vector of length 1, which we multiply by
the speed.

The paddle only bounces the ball while `ball_velocity.y > 0.0` (moving
down). Without that check, a ball that clipped the paddle's side could stay
overlapping it and bounce back and forth every frame, stuck inside.

### Particles

When a brick breaks, 12 particles fly out in random directions:

```rust
let angle = rng.range(0.0, TAU); // TAU = 2π = a full circle
let speed = rng.range(30.0, 120.0);
self.particles.push(Particle {
    position: at,
    velocity: vec2(angle.cos(), angle.sin()) * speed,
    life: rng.range(0.3, PARTICLE_LIFE),
    color,
});
```

Each frame, gravity pulls them down, they move, and they age. Dead ones are
dropped with `retain`. When drawn, `Color::lerp` fades each one into the
background color as its life runs out. Particles don't change gameplay at
all, but they make it feel much better. Game developers call this
"juice".

### Drawing order is layering

`draw` paints back to front: background, bricks, particles, paddle, ball,
then text on top. Later drawing covers earlier drawing, like painting on a
canvas (it's called the *painter's algorithm*).

### Restarting in one line

```rust
*self = Breakout::new();
```

`self` is a `&mut Breakout`, a reference. `*self` means "the thing it
points to", so this replaces the entire game with a fresh one. The old
bricks, particles and score are freed automatically.

## 19. Physics

`src/physics.rs` makes things fall, bounce, slide and stack. Run
`cargo run --example physics` and play with it, then read along.

### Using it

```rust
use duckforge::physics::{Body, PhysicsWorld};

let mut world = PhysicsWorld::new(vec2(0.0, 500.0)); // gravity: 500 px/s², downward
world.add(Body::block(vec2(160.0, 230.0), vec2(320.0, 20.0)).fixed()); // the floor
let ball = world.add(Body::ball(vec2(160.0, 20.0), 8.0).with_bounce(0.6));

// Then, every frame:
world.step(ctx.dt());
let position = world.get(ball).unwrap().position; // draw the ball here
```

A **body** has a position, a velocity, a shape (`Ball` or `Block`), a
bounciness, a friction and a mass. A **fixed** body never moves on its
own. Use it for floors, walls and pegs. The world doesn't draw anything:
your game draws each body wherever the physics says it is. That's what
`draw` in `examples/physics.rs` does.

**The units are up to you.** The 2D sandbox works in pixels (gravity 400
px/s², y down), and the 3D playground works in meters (gravity 9.8 m/s², y up).
The physics code doesn't care.

### One step at a time

Each `step` is split into 4 *substeps* (smaller steps are more accurate).
Each substep does five things:

1. **Gravity** speeds up every body: `velocity += gravity * h`.
2. **Collision detection** finds every pair of overlapping bodies. Each
   overlap becomes a *contact*: which way to push (the *normal*) and how
   deep the overlap is.
3. **The solver** changes velocities so touching bodies stop moving into
   each other.
4. **Integration** moves everything: `position += velocity * h`.
5. **Separation** pushes apart anything that still overlaps.

Updating the velocity first, and *then* moving with the new velocity, is
called *semi-implicit Euler integration*. It's simple and surprisingly
stable, which is why most game physics engines use it.

### Detecting collisions

There are three pairs of shapes, so three tests:

- **Ball vs ball:** they overlap when the distance between their centers
  is less than their two radii added together:

  ```rust
  let offset = b - a;
  let distance_squared = offset.dot(offset);
  let reach = radius_a + radius_b;
  if distance_squared >= reach * reach {
      return None;
  }
  ```

  Comparing *squared* distances skips a slow square root in the common case
  where nothing touches.
- **Box vs box:** two boxes overlap only if they overlap along *every*
  axis. They're pushed apart along the axis where they overlap *least*,
  which is the shortest way out.
- **Ball vs box:** find the point of the box nearest to the ball's center
  (clamp the center's coordinates to the box), then do a ball-style
  distance test against that point.

Checking every pair of bodies means about 20,000 checks for 200 bodies.
That's fine here, but big engines first throw away far-apart pairs with a
cheap *broad phase* (a grid, for example).

### Impulses: the solver

When two bodies collide, the solver applies an **impulse**, an instant
push. The same push changes a light body's velocity more than a heavy
one's: `velocity change = impulse / mass`. That's why the engine stores
`inverse_mass = 1 / mass`. A fixed body gets `0.0`, meaning "infinitely
heavy", and every formula just works:

```rust
let speed = (b.velocity - a.velocity).dot(n);
let impulse = (contact.target_speed - speed) / total_inverse_mass;
// Contacts can push but never pull, so the *total* impulse can't go below 0.
let new_total = (contact.normal_impulse + impulse).max(0.0);
let impulse = new_total - contact.normal_impulse;
contact.normal_impulse = new_total;
a.velocity -= n * (impulse * a.inverse_mass);
b.velocity += n * (impulse * b.inverse_mass);
```

- `speed` is how fast the bodies are separating along the normal (negative
  means approaching).
- `target_speed` is how fast they *should* separate: the approach speed
  times `bounce` for a real hit, and `0` for things at rest. (Without that
  second case, a ball on the floor would keep making tiny bounces forever.)
- **Bounce:** with `0.8`, a ball comes back at 80% of its speed and reaches
  `0.8 x 0.8 = 64%` of the height. A test checks exactly that.
- **Friction** works the same way, but along the surface instead of along
  the normal. It can never be stronger than
  `friction x how hard the bodies press together` (Coulomb's law of
  friction), which is why a heavy box is harder to slide.

Fixing one contact can disturb its neighbors (think of a stack of boxes),
so the solver goes over all the contacts 8 times, getting closer to the
right answer each time. This method is called **sequential impulses**, and
it's how Box2D works, the 2D physics engine behind Angry Birds.

### Reacting to collisions

After each step, `world.contacts()` lists every pair that touched, and
`world.touching(a, b)` checks a single pair. The sandbox uses this to light
up the pegs:

```rust
for contact in self.world.contacts() {
    for id in [contact.a, contact.b] {
        if self.pegs.contains(&id) {
            self.glow.insert(id, GLOW_TIME);
        }
    }
}
```

It's the same idea for "did the player land on the ground?" or "did the
ball reach the goal?".

### Limits

To keep the code readable, boxes never rotate (they're *axis-aligned*). So
a box can balance on a single peg, which a real one wouldn't. Rotation needs
angular velocity, moments of inertia and a much harder box-vs-box test. If
you want to go there, *Box2D-lite* by Erin Catto is a famously clear small
engine to read.

## 20. 3D graphics

All the 3D code is in `src/render3d.rs`, and it all ends up as triangles on
the same canvas the 2D drawing uses. Run `cargo run --example world3d` and
fly around first.

### Directions

In 3D, the engine uses **x = right, y = up, z = forward** (into the
screen). Careful: *y points up* in 3D but *down* in 2D screen coordinates.

### From a 3D point to a pixel

Every corner of every triangle goes through four steps:

1. **Model to world.** A `Transform` scales, rotates and moves a mesh into
   place: `Transform::at(position).sized(2.0)`.
2. **World to camera.** Shift everything so the camera sits at (0, 0, 0),
   then undo the camera's rotation, so it's looking straight along +z:

   ```rust
   pub fn to_camera_space(&self, point: Vec3) -> Vec3 {
       (point - self.position)
           .rotate_y(-self.yaw)
           .rotate_x(-self.pitch)
   }
   ```

3. **Projection.** Divide by the distance, `z`:

   ```rust
   vec2(
       width / 2.0 + p.x / p.z * focal_length,
       height / 2.0 - p.y / p.z * focal_length, // minus: screen y points down
   )
   ```

   Something twice as far away is drawn half as big: that's all perspective
   is. `focal_length` comes from the camera's field of view. A narrower
   view gives a bigger number, which zooms in.
4. **Rasterization.** Fill the triangle's pixels with `fill_triangle_3d`,
   checking depth as it goes.

### Which way is a triangle facing?

The **cross product** of two edges of a triangle gives a vector sticking
straight out of it, called its *normal*:

```rust
let normal = (b - a).cross(c - a).normalized();
```

Which side it sticks out of depends on the order of the corners. The rule
in this engine: **corners go clockwise when you look at the front**. That
makes two tricks possible:

- **Back-face culling.** If the normal points away from the camera, we're
  looking at the back of the triangle (the inside of a solid object), so
  it's skipped. That halves the work.

  ```rust
  if normal.dot(a - camera.position) >= 0.0 {
      continue;
  }
  ```

- **Lighting.** The **dot product** of the normal and the direction to the
  sun is 1 when the triangle faces the sun head-on, and 0 when it's edge-on:

  ```rust
  let sunlight = normal.dot(sun).max(0.0);
  let brightness = AMBIENT_LIGHT + (1.0 - AMBIENT_LIGHT) * sunlight;
  ```

  `AMBIENT_LIGHT` stops the shaded sides going pitch black. Using one
  brightness for the whole triangle is called *flat shading*. It gives the
  faceted look.

A test checks that every triangle of every built-in mesh faces outward.
Get one backwards and it would be invisible from outside.

### The depth buffer

When two triangles cover the same pixel, the nearer one should win.
Drawing everything from far to near would work for simple scenes, but it
fails when triangles overlap in complicated ways. The standard answer is
a **depth buffer**: a second array with one number per pixel, holding the
distance of whatever was drawn there. A new pixel is only drawn if it's
closer:

```rust
if d > depth[i] {
    depth[i] = d;
    pixels[i] = c32;
}
```

It stores `1 / distance` instead of the distance, because `1 / distance`
changes *evenly* across a triangle on screen. So blending the three corners'
values with the triangle weights from [chapter 15](#triangles) gives exactly
the right answer. Bigger means closer, and `canvas.clear()` resets every
pixel to `0.0` ("nothing here yet").

The test `draws_cubes_with_near_ones_in_front` draws a near cube *first*
and a bigger, far cube *second*, and checks that the near one still ends up
in front.

### Clipping: things behind you

Projection divides by `z`. Behind the camera `z` is negative and the math
produces garbage, and at exactly `0` it divides by zero. So before
projecting, each triangle is **clipped** against a plane just in front of
the camera (`z = 0.05`), and any part behind it is cut off. Cutting one
corner off a triangle leaves a four-sided shape, which is drawn as two
triangles. Without clipping, the floor (which is always partly behind you)
would glitch or vanish.

### Meshes

A `Mesh` is a list of corner points (`vertices`) plus a list of `Triangle`s
that refer to corners by index, so corners shared by several triangles are
stored once. The built-in meshes (`cube`, `pyramid`, `sphere`,
`checkerboard`) are all 1 unit big, so a transform's scale *is* the
object's size. You can also build your own. `examples/world3d.rs` builds the
shadow disc from one center point and a ring of points around it:

```rust
let center = mesh.add_vertex(Vec3::ZERO);
```

and one triangle per slice:

```rust
mesh.add_triangle(center, ring[next], ring[i], color);
```

### How the 3D playground uses physics

`examples/world3d.rs` runs a `PhysicsWorld<Vec3>`, and each frame it draws
a mesh at every body's position:

```rust
(Look::Ball(color), Shape::Ball { radius }) => (
    &self.ball_meshes[color],
    Transform::at(body.position).sized(radius * 2.0),
),
```

It also uses two classic cheap tricks:

- **Blob shadows.** A dark disc on the ground under each object, smaller the
  higher up it is. Real shadows are much harder!
- **Endless ground.** `world_to_screen` finds where the horizon is on
  screen, and everything below it is painted grass-colored before the
  checkerboard is drawn. So the world doesn't seem to end in mid-air.

### What about the graphics card?

Real 3D engines send triangles to the GPU, which runs these same steps
(transform, clip, cull, rasterize, depth test) in hardware, on millions of
triangles per frame. This engine can do that too: that's the next chapter.
The CPU renderer in this chapter stays, as a fallback and as the version
you can read line by line.

## 21. Moving 3D to the GPU

A graphics card (GPU) is a chip with thousands of small processors that
all run the same short program at once, on different data: one per
triangle corner, then one per pixel. Our CPU renderer handles triangles
one after another. `src/gpu.rs` hands them to the GPU instead, using the
**wgpu** crate, which talks to whatever graphics API the computer has
(DirectX 12 on Windows, Metal on Mac, Vulkan or OpenGL on Linux).

Nothing changes for games: `draw_mesh` has the same signature, and all
the examples run unchanged. By default the engine uses the GPU if there's
a usable one, and falls back to the CPU (with a message saying why) if not.

### Measure first: the stress test

Before changing anything, `examples/stress3d.rs` measured the CPU renderer
by drawing thousands of spinning shapes:

```sh
cargo run --release --example stress3d -- --objects 5000 --seconds 10 --renderer cpu
cargo run --release --example stress3d -- --objects 5000 --seconds 10 --renderer gpu
```

(Everything after the `--` goes to the program, not to Cargo.) It runs
without a frame-rate cap, ignores the first two seconds while things warm
up, then prints the average FPS and quits.

Writing the benchmark first also caught a bug: the F3 counter said 215
FPS while the benchmark measured 77. The very first frame is timed from a
moment just before the loop started, so it looked like "20 million FPS",
and the average took ages to forget it. The fix (skip that frame, and
average frame *times* rather than FPS values) came with a test.

### The plan: draw offscreen, copy back

The window library (minifb) shows a block of pixels in memory. So the GPU
renderer draws 3D into an image *on the graphics card*, then copies the
finished image back into the canvas's pixels:

1. `draw_mesh` doesn't draw. It records which mesh to draw, and where.
2. When the picture is needed, the recorded objects are drawn on the GPU,
   on top of a copy of the canvas (so 2D drawn *before* the 3D stays
   underneath), with the GPU's own depth buffer.
3. The result is copied back into `canvas.pixels`.

"When the picture is needed" means: the next time anything is drawn in 2D
(so 2D drawn *after* 3D lands on top), or at the end of the frame, when the
engine calls `canvas.flush_3d()`. That keeps the layering exactly as it
was with the CPU renderer. And a game that never draws 3D never even
starts the GPU.

### Setting up wgpu

wgpu's setup follows the WebGPU standard: an *instance* (the library), an
*adapter* (one graphics card), and a *device* plus *queue* (our connection
to it, and the way to send it work):

```rust
let instance =
    wgpu::Instance::new(wgpu::InstanceDescriptor::new_without_display_handle_from_env());
```

```rust
let adapter = pollster::block_on(instance.request_adapter(&wgpu::RequestAdapterOptions {
    power_preference: wgpu::PowerPreference::HighPerformance,
    ..Default::default()
}))
.map_err(|err| format!("no graphics adapter found: {err}"))?;
```

`request_adapter` is an `async` function: it returns a *future*, a value
that will be ready later. Asking the operating system for a graphics card
can take a moment, and on the web you're not allowed to just wait. On the
desktop, waiting is fine, so `pollster::block_on` waits until the future
finishes. (Rust's `async` is a big topic; for this engine, "call
`block_on`" is all you need.)

### Shaders: programs for the graphics card

The GPU runs programs called **shaders**, written here in WGSL, the WebGPU
Shading Language (`src/gpu.wgsl`). It looks a lot like Rust. Two run for
every object:

- The **vertex shader** (`vs_main`) runs once per triangle corner. It
  multiplies the corner by the object's matrix and the camera's matrix to
  find where it lands on screen.
- The **fragment shader** (`fs_main`) runs once per pixel the triangle
  covers, and returns its color. It uses the same lighting formula as the
  CPU renderer:

  ```wgsl
  let sunlight = max(dot(normal, globals.sun.xyz), 0.0);
  let ambient = globals.sun.w;
  let brightness = ambient + (1.0 - ambient) * sunlight;
  return vec4<f32>(in.color * brightness, 1.0);
  ```

  The CPU finds a triangle's normal from its three corners. A pixel
  program only sees one pixel, so it asks how the position changes towards
  the neighboring pixels (`dpdx` and `dpdy`): two directions lying in the
  triangle, whose cross product is the normal.

### Matrices: many steps in one

The CPU renderer moves each corner step by step: scale, rotate three times,
move, then the camera's undo-moves. The GPU wants all of that as a single
**4x4 matrix** per object, so `src/math.rs` gained `Mat4`. Multiplying two
matrices gives one matrix that does both jobs, read right to left:

```rust
pub fn view_matrix(&self) -> Mat4 {
    Mat4::rotation_x(-self.pitch)
        * Mat4::rotation_y(-self.yaw)
        * Mat4::translation(-self.position)
}
```

The GPU picture must match the CPU picture, so a test checks that the
matrices put points in exactly the same places as `Transform::apply`,
`to_camera_space` and the CPU's projection:

```rust
assert!(transform.matrix().transform_point(point).distance(world) < 1e-4);
```

A second test draws a whole scene with both renderers and checks that
fewer than 2% of the pixels differ (a few edge pixels round differently).

The projection matrix produces a depth of `near / distance`: bigger means
closer, the same idea as the CPU renderer's `1 / distance`. GPU
programmers call this *reversed Z*, and it keeps far-away depths precise.

### Talking in bytes: `#[repr(C)]` and bytemuck

The GPU receives raw bytes, so the data sent to it must have an exact,
known layout:

```rust
struct Vertex {
    position: [f32; 3],
    color: [u8; 4],
}
```

`#[repr(C)]` tells Rust to lay the fields out in order, with no
rearranging, and `#[derive(Pod, Zeroable)]` from bytemuck promises the type
is "plain old data" (any bytes are a valid value). Then
`bytemuck::cast_slice(&vertices)` views a whole `Vec<Vertex>` as bytes
without copying anything.

A small trick saves a conversion every frame. A canvas pixel `0x00RRGGBB`
sits in memory as the bytes B, G, R, 0, which is exactly the GPU texture
format `Bgra8Unorm`. So the canvas can be sent to the GPU, and read back,
as it is.

### Instancing: one draw call for many objects

Telling the GPU "draw this" has a cost of its own, so drawing 10,000 cubes
with 10,000 commands would be slow. Instead, every copy of the same mesh is
drawn with **one** command. The objects' matrices go in a second buffer,
which the pipeline reads with `VertexStepMode::Instance`: "move to the next
matrix only for the next *copy* of the mesh":

```rust
// One draw call per mesh, however many copies of it there are.
let mut first = 0u32;
for (key, instances) in &batches {
    let count = instances.len() as u32;
    let mesh = &self.meshes[key];
    pass.set_vertex_buffer(0, mesh.vertex_buffer.slice(..));
    pass.set_vertex_buffer(1, self.instance_buffer.slice(..));
    pass.draw(0..mesh.vertex_count, first..first + count);
    first += count;
}
```

The stress test uses 18 different meshes, so even 20,000 objects take only
18 draw calls.

### The mesh cache, and a bug caught before it shipped

Each mesh is sent to the GPU once and kept there. But how do we recognize a
mesh we've seen before? `Mesh` has public fields, so a game can change one
at any time, and there's no id to go by.

The first version used the mesh's *address* in memory. Then I noticed that
this code would break it:

```rust
canvas.draw_mesh(&Mesh::cube(Color::RED), &left, &camera);
canvas.draw_mesh(&Mesh::cube(Color::BLUE), &right, &camera);
```

Each temporary cube is dropped right after its line, so the blue cube is
very likely built at the same address as the red one. Both would have been
drawn red! So the cache key is the address *plus a fingerprint* (a hash of
the whole mesh). Fingerprinting is slow for big meshes, so within one batch
it's only done once per address, and repeat draws just compare a small
*sample* (the first, middle and last corner and triangle):

```rust
fn key_for(&mut self, mesh: &Mesh) -> MeshKey {
    let address = address_of(mesh);
    let quick = sample(mesh);
    match self.seen.get(&address) {
        Some(seen) if seen.sample == quick => (address, seen.fingerprint),
```

There's a test for exactly that red-and-blue case, and one for editing a
mesh between frames.

### Reading the picture back

After the GPU draws, the picture is copied into a buffer the CPU can read.
Two details:

- Each row in that buffer must take a multiple of 256 bytes, so rows are
  *padded*, and the padding is skipped when copying into the canvas:

  ```rust
  let padded_bytes_per_row = (width * 4).div_ceil(wgpu::COPY_BYTES_PER_ROW_ALIGNMENT)
      * wgpu::COPY_BYTES_PER_ROW_ALIGNMENT;
  ```

- The GPU works *alongside* the CPU. `map_async` asks for the buffer, and
  `device.poll(PollType::wait_indefinitely())` waits until the GPU has
  finished drawing and the bytes are ready.

### Falling back to the CPU

The canvas keeps track of its GPU with an enum, a small state machine like
Breakout's:

```rust
enum GpuSlot {
    /// Draw 3D on the CPU.
    Off,
    /// Use the GPU, but nothing needed it yet. It starts at the first `draw_mesh`.
    NotStarted,
    /// The GPU is ready. (`Box` keeps the big renderer out of the `Canvas` itself.)
    Running(Box<GpuRenderer>),
    /// Starting the GPU didn't work, so 3D is drawn on the CPU.
    Failed,
}
```

And `draw_mesh` tries the GPU first:

```rust
pub fn draw_mesh(&mut self, mesh: &Mesh, transform: &Transform, camera: &Camera3D) {
    #[cfg(feature = "gpu")]
    if self.draw_mesh_on_gpu(mesh, transform, camera) {
        return; // the graphics card will draw it (see gpu.rs)
    }

    // Otherwise, draw it right here on the CPU.
```

You choose the renderer with `Config::renderer` (`Auto`, `Gpu` or `Cpu`),
or for any game without touching code, with the `DUCKFORGE_RENDERER`
environment variable. `ctx.renderer_name()` tells a game which one is
actually drawing.

### Measure, don't guess

The first GPU version spent about 380 nanoseconds of CPU time per object
just *recording* draws. That sounds tiny, but 20,000 objects make 7.6 ms
per frame, which would cap even the fastest graphics card at about 130 FPS.
My guess was the hashing, so I swapped in a faster hash function. It barely
helped (380 to 350 ns). Then I timed each step separately:

```text
Transform::matrix(): 242 ns per object
draw_mesh (record only): 288 ns per object
```

The matrix math was the real cost. `Mat4::transform` was written as a loop
the compiler couldn't optimize well, and every rotation was computed even
for an angle of zero. Writing the sums out and skipping zero rotations
brought `matrix()` to 71 ns and the whole recording to about 180 ns per
object. The lesson generalizes to all programming: **measure before you
optimize**. The slow part is often not where you'd guess.

### Numbers

Numbers from the 4-core cloud machine this was built on:

| Objects | Triangles | CPU renderer | wgpu on llvmpipe |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 500 | 21,828 | 177 FPS | 104 FPS |
| 2,000 | 88,728 | 79 FPS | 47 FPS |
| 5,000 | 222,336 | 40 FPS | 21 FPS |
| 10,000 | 452,520 | 22 FPS | 13 to 17 FPS |
| 20,000 | 906,840 | 12 FPS | 8 FPS |

Surprised? That machine has **no graphics card**. The "GPU" there is
*llvmpipe*, which imitates a graphics card in software on the same four CPU
cores, and it's slower than our CPU renderer, which only does exactly what
this engine needs. On a real graphics card the GPU column should be far
higher. Run the benchmark on your own computer to see the real difference.

### Limits and next steps

- The 3D picture has the canvas's resolution. For sharper 3D, make the
  canvas bigger in `Config` (with a smaller `scale`).
- Copying the picture back each frame costs a little time, and makes the CPU
  wait for the GPU. The next big step would be to let wgpu draw straight
  into the window, which means replacing minifb with a library like winit.

# Part 3: Your turn

## 22. Exercises

Do them in order. After each change, run the game and see what happened.
When the compiler complains, **read the whole error message**: Rust's error
messages are unusually helpful, and often include the fix.

### Warm-up: turn the knobs (`examples/breakout.rs`)

1. Make the paddle twice as wide. Then make the ball twice as fast.
2. Set `GRAVITY` to `-300.0`. What happens to the particles?
3. Give the player 5 lives.
4. Add a seventh row of bricks by adding a color to `ROW_COLORS`. The
   compiler will stop you:

   ```text
   error[E0308]: mismatched types
     expected an array with a size of 6, found one with a size of 7
   ```

   An array's length is part of its type. Fix the `6`.

### Small features

5. **High score.** Keep the best score across restarts and show it in the
   HUD. Careful: `*self = Breakout::new()` wipes everything. You'll need
   to save the high score in a variable, restart, then put it back.
6. **Tough bricks.** Give `Brick` a `hits_left: u32` field. Top-row bricks
   need two hits. Draw damaged bricks darker (`color.lerp(Color::BLACK, 0.4)`).
7. **Hello, in color.** In `examples/hello.rs`, make the square change color
   while Space is held. Then make it leave a trail: store the last 20
   positions in a `Vec<Vec2>` and draw them fading out.
8. **Follow the mouse.** In `examples/hello.rs`, make the square glide
   towards the mouse while the left button is held, instead of teleporting.
   (Hint: the direction is `(target - position).normalized()`.)

### Engine features

9. **Screen shake.** When a brick breaks, shake the screen for 0.2 seconds.
   Hint: add a `camera_offset: Vec2` field to `Canvas` that every drawing
   function adds to positions, and set it randomly each frame while shaking.
10. **Mouse paddle.** Let Breakout's paddle follow
    `ctx.input.mouse_position().x`, and keep the keyboard working too.
11. **Sprites.** Draw small pictures stored in the code, like the font:
    ```rust
    const INVADER: [&str; 4] = [
        "..#..#..",
        ".######.",
        "##.##.##",
        "#.#..#.#",
    ];
    ```
    Write `Canvas::draw_sprite(&mut self, sprite: &[&str], pos: Vec2, scale: u32, color: Color)`.
12. **Fixed timestep.** Change `run` to update in fixed steps of 1/60 s.
    Watch out: what should `was_pressed` do if two updates run in one frame?

### Physics and 3D

13. **Explosions.** In the physics sandbox, make X push every body away
    from the mouse, harder the closer it is. Collect the ids first, then
    call `get_mut` and `apply_impulse` on each. (Why can't you change the
    bodies while looping over `world.bodies()`?)
14. **Tilt the world.** `world.gravity` is a public field. Let the arrow
    keys change which way things fall.
15. **A moving platform.** Add a fixed block to the sandbox and give it a
    velocity that flips direction every 2 seconds. Fixed bodies still move
    by their velocity, and friction carries whatever sits on top.
16. **A snowman.** In the 3D playground, stack three white spheres of
    different sizes, then give it a small orange pyramid for a nose.
17. **Fog.** Add a `fog: Option<Color>` field to `Camera3D`. In the CPU
    `draw_mesh`, blend each triangle's color towards it the further away it
    is: `color.lerp(fog, (distance / 25.0).min(1.0))`. Then do the same in
    `fs_main` in `gpu.wgsl` (WGSL has `mix(a, b, t)`), passing the fog color
    in `Globals`. Run the stress test with both renderers to compare.
18. **A color per object.** Right now every color needs its own mesh. Add
    a `color: [f32; 4]` to the GPU's `Instance`, read it in the vertex
    shader, and multiply it in. One white cube mesh could then draw cubes of
    every color, with a single draw call.

### New games

Start by copying this skeleton to `examples/mygame.rs`, then run it with
`cargo run --example mygame`:

```rust
use duckforge::prelude::*;

struct MyGame {
    // your game's state goes here
}

impl Game for MyGame {
    fn update(&mut self, ctx: &mut Context) {
        if ctx.input.was_pressed(Key::Escape) {
            ctx.quit();
        }
        // move things, check collisions...
    }

    fn draw(&self, canvas: &mut Canvas) {
        canvas.clear(Color::BLACK);
        // draw things...
    }
}

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    duckforge::run(Config::default(), MyGame {})
}
```

19. **Pong.** Two paddles (W/S and Up/Down), one ball, a score for each
    side. You can reuse a lot of Breakout.
20. **Snake.** Use a grid: 16x16 pixel cells give a 20x15 board. The snake
    is a `VecDeque<(i32, i32)>` (from `std::collections`): push a new head,
    pop the tail. Move only every 0.1 s by adding up `dt` in a timer. Place
    food with `ctx.rng.range_i32(0, 20)`. Use an enum for the direction.
21. **Space invaders.** A ship, bullets in a `Vec`, rows of aliens that
    march sideways and step down.
22. **A 3D game.** A marble you steer with the arrow keys (apply impulses
    to a ball body) across floating platforms, with the camera following
    it. Or 3D Breakout, with a `PhysicsWorld<Vec3>`.

## 23. Common compiler errors

| Error    | Message (short)                                   | Usually means                                                 |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `E0384`  | cannot assign twice to immutable variable          | You forgot `mut`.                                             |
| `E0308`  | mismatched types                                   | Often `f32` vs `usize` vs `i32`: add an `as` conversion.       |
| `E0382`  | borrow of moved value                              | You used a value after moving it. Borrow with `&`, or `.clone()`. |
| `E0502`  | cannot borrow as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable | Reading and changing at once. Use "find first, change second". |
| `E0499`  | cannot borrow as mutable more than once at a time  | Two `&mut` to the same thing. Same fix as above.              |
| `E0004`  | non-exhaustive patterns                            | A `match` is missing a case. Handle it, or add `_ =>`.        |
| `E0425`  | cannot find value in this scope                    | A typo, or a missing `use`.                                   |
| `E0599`  | no method named `...` found                        | A typo, a missing `use` for a trait, or the wrong type.       |

For a long explanation of any error, run `rustc --explain E0502`.

## 24. Where to go next

- **The Rust Programming Language** ("the Book"), free at
  <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/>. The best way to learn Rust properly.
  You've already seen most of chapters 1 to 11!
- **Rustlings**: <https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings>. Small exercises
  that you fix until they compile.
- **Rust by Example**: <https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/>.
- **`cargo doc --open`** in this project shows the engine's documentation,
  with links to the standard library.
- **Physics:** *Box2D-lite* and the GDC talks by Erin Catto explain the
  sequential impulses used in `src/physics.rs`.
- **3D rendering:** [tinyrenderer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer) and
  [Scratchapixel](https://www.scratchapixel.com) build a software renderer
  step by step, like `src/render3d.rs` but with textures and smooth shading.
- **The GPU:** [Learn Wgpu](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/) walks
  through wgpu step by step, including drawing straight into a window.
- **Real Rust game engines**, now that you know what's under the hood:
  - [macroquad](https://macroquad.rs): simple, and similar in spirit to this engine, but GPU-powered.
  - [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org): a big, modern engine built around an *Entity Component System*.

Have fun, and break things. The compiler has your back.
