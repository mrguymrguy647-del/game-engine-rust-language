//! A small physics engine: balls and boxes that fall, bounce, slide and stack.
//!
//! It works in **2D and 3D** with the same code. Everything is generic over
//! `V: Vector`, and `V` is either [`Vec2`](crate::math::Vec2) or
//! [`Vec3`](crate::math::Vec3). Rust works out which one you mean from the
//! gravity you pass in:
//!
//! ```
//! use duckforge::physics::{Body, PhysicsWorld};
//! use duckforge::prelude::*;
//!
//! // 2D, in pixels. Screen y points down, so gravity is +y.
//! let mut world = PhysicsWorld::new(vec2(0.0, 500.0));
//! let floor = world.add(Body::block(vec2(160.0, 230.0), vec2(320.0, 20.0)).fixed());
//! let ball = world.add(Body::ball(vec2(160.0, 20.0), 8.0).with_bounce(0.6));
//!
//! for _ in 0..300 {
//!     world.step(1.0 / 60.0); // five seconds
//! }
//! let ball = world.get(ball).unwrap();
//! assert!((ball.position.y - 212.0).abs() < 1.0); // resting on the floor
//! ```
//!
//! Each call to [`PhysicsWorld::step`] runs a few small *substeps*, and each
//! substep:
//!
//! 1. lets gravity speed up every body,
//! 2. finds every pair of bodies that overlap (a *contact*),
//! 3. changes their velocities so they stop moving into each other, bouncing
//!    and applying friction (the *solver*),
//! 4. moves every body by its velocity,
//! 5. pushes apart bodies that still overlap.
//!
//! To keep the math simple, boxes are *axis-aligned*: they never rotate.
